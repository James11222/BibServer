	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present models of turbulent mixing at the boundaries between hot (T ~ 106-107 K) and warm material (T ~ 104 K) in the interstellar medium, using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code, with radiative cooling. The source of turbulence in our simulations is a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, produced by shear between the two media. We find that because the growth rate of the large-scale modes in the instability is rather slow, it takes a significant amount of time (~1 Myr) for turbulence to produce effective mixing. We also find that the total column densities of the highly ionized species (C IV, N V, and O VI) per interface (assuming ionization equilibrium) are similar to previous steady state nonequilibrium ionization models but grow slowly from log N ~ 1011 to a few ×1012 cm-2 as the interface evolves. However, the column density ratios can differ significantly from previous estimates, with an order of magnitude variation in N(C )/N(O ) as the mixing develops.}
